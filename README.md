**Code review by**

Dante Morgrim @morgrim-91

1. README.md needs completion.
2. Some pictures related to the article would be nice.
3. The ‘like counter’ could’ve had a counting function of some sort.
4. The content could be more responsive/accessible.
5. Ask two people to test run the site for you, to double check that everything works.

“Altogether nice, clean and minimalist design. Really impressed how you managed to make to code so dry. Cool banner. Excellent job!”
